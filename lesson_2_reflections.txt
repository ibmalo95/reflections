You need to initialize a repository in order to be able to starting 
commiting. When you initialize it it says you have initialized the 
repository, that it is empty, and where it is located.

The staging area is different from the working directory and the 
repository because it is a temporary place for files to go before
comitting them. The benefits of it is that you know which files you
want to commit without having to commit them all.

git add - add files to staging area
