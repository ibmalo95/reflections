When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all you work local?
You would want to us a remote repository in order to back up your work or if you wanted others
to contribute to it. When your work is only local you have the potential of losing it if it's
not backed up somehow and furthermore no one else can contribute to it unless you give them the 
information to clone it themselves.
